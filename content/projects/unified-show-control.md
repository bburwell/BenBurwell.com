Title: Unified Show Control
Description: A paper on unifying all aspects of theatrical show control.
Date: 13 January 2013

For my freshman writing seminar at Muhlenberg, I wrote a paper on a system I devised for controlling many different theatrical cueing consoles from one master console using MIDI Show Control (MSC).  I called my system [Unified Show Control](/images/UnifiedShowControl.pdf) (pdf).

Shortly after finishing this project, I discovered that [QLab] from Figure 53 already has MSC built into it. Though it was slightly disappointing, I was thrilled that my idea already exists, albeit in a slightly different form.
